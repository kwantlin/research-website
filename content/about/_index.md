**I** am a 2nd year Master's student in Computer Science at Princeton University, advised by [Prof. Ryan Adams][1] and [Prof. Naomi Leonard.][2] I am also a Visiting Postgraduate Research Fellow at the Harvard Medical AI Lab, advised by [Prof. Pranav Rajpurkar.][3] Previously, I received my A.B in Computer Science with a secondary in Economics and Chinese Language Citation from Harvard University, where my thesis was advised by [Prof. David Parkes.][4]

My research interests center around the design of algorithms for machine learning and multi-agent systems that are flexible, robust, and generalizable, with applications in engineering, natural sciences, and the arts.
